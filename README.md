## Python Script to Download a YouTube Video. 
* TBH, I hate when I want to download a Y.T Video and I can't just save it directly to my local.storage and again when you want to look for an external website to download it via YT URL, yes you get what you want but at the expense of annoying ads
* This is why I decided to create this python script to make life easy and things just a little bit more simpler.
* Cheers ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

## How to Install. 
* Install this pip package. 
```
pip install yt-dlp
```
* run with this cmd
```
python nickbiiy-yt-video-downloader.py
```
Enjoy ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
